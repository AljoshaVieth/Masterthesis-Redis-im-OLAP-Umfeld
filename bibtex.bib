The cube storage module converts dimension members into binary keys and leverages a novel distributed database to provide efficient storage for huge cuboids. The bit encoding sparse index is used to compress the cube data and the dimension bit encoding key with maximum members is used to achieve cube data sharding and distributed aggregation computing. We discuss how to match the star schema with cube model databases, and how to use resilient distributed data-sets for MDX-like queries executing on key-value systems. Finally, some queries of TPC-DS benchmark are adopted to validate the prototype implementation of the MOLAP engine. The results indicate that designed scenarios based on TPC-DS are suitable for various big data analytics operation benchmarking.},

Techniques proposed in data warehousing and online analytical processing (OLAP), such as precomputed multidimensional cubes, dramatically improve the response time of analytic queries based on relational databases. There are some recent works extending similar concepts into NoSQL such as constructing cubes from NoSQL stores and converting existing cubes into NoSQL stores. However, only few works are studying the precomputing structure deliberately within NoSQL databases. In this paper, we present an architecture for answering temporal analytic queries over big data by precomputing the results of granulated chunks of collections which are decomposed from the original large collection. By using the precomputing structure, we are able to answer the drill-down and roll-up temporal queries over large amount of data within reasonable response time.},

	abstract = {OLAP is a technology that allows analysts to perform
multidimensional data analysis, and view business data
from different angles. It enables users to analyze informations
from multiple and heterogeneous databases. Over the last few
years, Not-only-SQL(NoSQL) databases were created and gained
a lot of interest and popularity in OLTP systems. In despite of
that, a few works have investigated the possibility to use NoSQL
technologies to implement big OLAP cubes. Our main goal is
to propose a new model for managing cubes into NoSQL key
value stores, for this purpose, we present in this paper two
approaches which allow cubes to be implemented under key value
model, and we show how these structures can then be used to
support decision making by responding to OLAP basic analytical
operations. The first approach discusses how to match the star
schema with key value model based on a tabular structure layered
on top of the distributed key-value model. The second approach
performs OLAP cube computation named CV-CUBE operator
by converting dimension members into binary keys.

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel approach that allows the
retrieval of OLAP analytics by means of storing multidimensional
data in key-value databases is described and evaluated.
The proposed mechanism relies on generated keys based on
the path-enumeration model built upon a tree representation
of a relational database. Each key represents a combination of
OLAP dimension labels and is inserted into a key-value sorted
set where its associated values are the metrics of interest, i.e.,
the OLAP facts. Our implementation for a real advertisement
server system in Redis and its performance comparison with
a relational OLAP (ROLAP) database running on top of
MySQL, show that our proposed scheme can answer complex
multidimensional queries much faster, while keeping a great
flexibility of the data schema. In contrast with general ROLAP
schemes, which usually require the pre-computation of tables
for specific queries, the sorted sets in the proposed system are
not pre-computed but generated on demand, so no further
delay is introduced. To the best of the authors’ knowledge,
this is the first system that deals with mapping relational
data structures into sorted sets of key-value store databases
to answer complex queries on multidimensional data.},

	abstract = {Data warehousing and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) are essential elements of decision support, which has increasingly become a focus of the database industry. Many commercial products and services are now available, and all of the principal database management system vendors now have offerings in these areas. Decision support places some rather different requirements on database technology compared to traditional on-line transaction processing applications. This paper provides an overview of data warehousing and OLAP technologies, with an emphasis on their new requirements. We describe back end tools for extracting, cleaning and loading data into a data warehouse; multidimensional data models typical of OLAP; front end client tools for querying and data analysis; server extensions for efficient query processing; and tools for metadata management and for managing the warehouse. In addition to surveying the state of the art, this paper also identifies some promising research issues, some of which are related to problems that the database research community has worked on for years, but others are only just beginning to be addressed. This overview is based on a tutorial that the authors presented at the VLDB Conference, 1996.},
